Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am an IT graduate with a huge passion for software engineering, and more specifically, web development. My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create smart, innovative solutions that make a positive influence on other people's lives.

In this portfolio, you'll find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience as a software engineer. In each project, you'll find a detailed summary of the project, how to operate the project and what technology stack I used. Please note, this is still a work in progress.

Feel free to browse through my portfolio, and if you have any questions or comments , don't hesitate to reach out to me through my email: [mail@joshuabertucci.com](mailto:mail@joshuabertucci.com).

Thank you for visiting!
